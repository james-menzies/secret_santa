# Secret Santa

This application is a micro-game designed purely around creating the social interaction of Secret Santa, but in a virtualized, online environment. All users involved in an event can send an received an emoji gift under the guise of random mystery. What fun!

## How it Works
1. Once a user is registered, they can create an event. Invites are sent by specifying an email.
2. If a user isn't registered, they'll be invited via the specified email to join up. Once registered they'll be automatically be added to the event. There's no opting out once you've joined Secret Santa, once you're in, you're in!
3. When the creator of an event is happy that everyone has joined, they can set a time for the big reveal. The gift givers and recipients are all determined and people can start giving.
4. Now the fun begins! Users will be notified that they have some gifting to do, and can choose their emoji and personalized message of choice.
5. When the big reveal happense users can log in and open their present, if their gift givers went MIA they'll receive coal instead :(
6. Grinches are pubically shamed, as they should be.
